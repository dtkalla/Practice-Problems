# Practice Problems

Other than actual projects, I mostly practice coding with three sites: Codewars, Project Euler, and LeetCode.  This repository includes a selection of problems I enjoyed from different sites.  I generally prefer coding in Ruby, but I like to code in Python periodically as well and keep my skills sharp, so both are used here.

Each problem has the prompt at the top and my work below.  All of the problems were fun and challenging, and they all show my coding style fairly well.
